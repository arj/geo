//! The World class defines a distinct world of entities.
//! Think of it as an infinite room with a coordinate system.
//!
//! Internally, the world keeps track of all created objects, especially
//! geometric objects are only stored once and given an id.
//!
//! Furthermore, the world provides means of fast object discovery.
//! And thus works with several (configurable) caches.
